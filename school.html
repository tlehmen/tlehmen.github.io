    <h3>Classes</h3>

    <h3>Graduation</h3>

    <div>
      <p>I wish I had a good graduation date, but Truth is, I'm not sure when that will be. I am currently deciding between a two year and a four year computer science degree. Then after I have completed one of those I intend to go back to school to get a two year Business and Marketing degree so I can further the business I want to start.</p>

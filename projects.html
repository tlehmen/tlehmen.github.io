    <h3>Projects</h3>

    <div>
      <p>Right now I don't have any started projects that were not part of a class. I do intend to start a big project which will be a prototype website for the business I plan on starting. I'm in the process of coming up with a name for the business and what I might sell and then I am going to make a wireframe for the sight and edit it to my visual pleasure. My boyfriend also repairs tech so I'm probably going to have a section in the sight where he can sell his stuff. It is most deffinatly a project I'm extremelu excited to even start and work on the not so fun parts.</p>
